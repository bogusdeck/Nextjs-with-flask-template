# Next.js and Flask Project Template

This is a simple project template for building a web application using Next.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project template, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Python 3 and pip

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-flask-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nextjs-flask-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Development

To run the development servers for both the frontend and backend:

1. Start the Flask backend server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Start the Next.js frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The Flask backend server will be running at `http://localhost:5000`, and the Next.js frontend development server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
